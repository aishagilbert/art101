		<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
			<p>My partner and I worked together to figure out why our javascript wasn't linking to our page at first. We then asked Emily for help and realized that there was a typo in our code. Instead of writing writeln, I had accidentally put writln which was causing the whole code to not work. However, now everything works!</p>
