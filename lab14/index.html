      <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>⋆We were tasked with debugging our old labs.⋆</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>｡°The main issue we faced within our labs was correctly linking our CSS pages in our HTML code. Lab 5 was an easy fix. We had simply misnamed our css stylesheet in our HTML code, it didn’t match the name on our CSS folder. After we corrected this, our CSS was shown on our webpage. For lab 6, it was a tougher one to figure out because the mistake was very minute. We had forgotten the backslash between css and labs in our href="css/labs.css" code. Before this fix, our web pages were blank. ˚✩</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Here are our updated pages!˚✩彡</p>
