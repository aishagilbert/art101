		<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<p>We were unclear on how to use javascript and how to view the outcome of that code. We were also unclear on whether or not task 1 and task 2 should be written out simply in a document or if it should be coded in a list format.
		<h1>Problems</h1>
			We were having trouble understanding some of the instructions and we are not sure if our format for task 4 is correct.
		<h1>Results</h1>
			We have a javascript code and an image in the img folder which is linked down below. We were able to create ordered lists for the psuedocoding tasks. I am hoping this will appear correctly on the chrome browser.
			<pre><code>
				// Have a 3 second timer
			 // Allow user to select one of the options during the 3 second count down
			 // Have a randomized option selected by the computer during the 3 second countdown
			 // Show the chosen options on screen at the same time
			 // Winner or loser title will be displayed based on results
		 </pre></code>
